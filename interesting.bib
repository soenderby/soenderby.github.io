abstract="New laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grant users unprecedented control over personal data stored and processed by businesses. Compliance can require expensive manual labor or retrofitting of existing systems, e.g., to handle data retrieval and removal requests. We argue for treating these new requirements as an opportunity for new system designs. These designs should make data ownership a first-class concern and achieve compliance with privacy legislation by construction. A compliant-by-construction system could build a shared database, with similar performance as current systems, from personal databases that let users contribute, audit, retrieve, and remove their personal data through easy-to-understand APIs. Realizing compliant-by-construction systems requires new cross-cutting abstractions that make data dependencies explicit and that augment classic data processing pipelines with ownership information.",

abstract="With the arrival of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), several companies are making significant changes to their systems to achieve compliance. The changes range from modifying privacy policies to redesigning systems which process personal data. Privacy policy is the main medium of information dissemination between the data controller and the users. This work analyzes the privacy policies of large-scaled cloud services which seek to be GDPR compliant. We show that many services that claim compliance today do not have clear and concise privacy policies. We identify several points in the privacy policies which potentially indicate non-compliance; we term these GDPR dark patterns. We identify GDPR dark patterns in ten large-scale cloud services. Based on our analysis, we propose seven best practices for crafting GDPR privacy policies.",

abstract="The increasing pace of data collection has led to increasing awareness of privacy risks, resulting in new data privacy regulations like General data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Such regulations are an important step, but automatic compliance checking is challenging. In this work, we present a new paradigm, Data Capsule, for automatic compliance checking of data privacy regulations in heterogeneous data processing infrastructures. Our key insight is to pair up a data subject's data with a policy governing how the data is processed. Specified in our formal policy language: PrivPolicy, the policy is created and provided by the data subject alongside the data, and is associated with the data throughout the life-cycle of data processing (e.g., data transformation by data processing systems, data aggregation of multiple data subjects' data). We introduce a solution for static enforcement of privacy policies based on the concept of residual policies, and present a novel algorithm based on abstract interpretation for deriving residual policies in PrivPolicy. Our solution ensures compliance automatically, and is designed for deployment alongside existing infrastructure. We also design and develop PrivGuard, a reference data capsule manager that implements all the functionalities of Data Capsule paradigm.",

In such a world, how can systems plausibly comply with the regulations governing the collection, use, and management of such data? We claim that distributed data provenance, the directed acyclic graph documenting the origin and transformations of data holds the key. Provenance analysis has already been demonstrated in a wide range of applications: from intrusion detection to performance analysis. We describe how similar systems and analysis techniques are suitable both for implementing the complex policies that govern data and verifying compliance with regulatory mandates. We also highlight the challenges to be addressed to move provenance from research laboratories to production systems.",

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly important for applications to protect sensitive data. With current techniques, the programmer bears the burden of ensuring that the application's behavior adheres to policies about where sensitive values may flow. Unfortunately, privacy policies are difficult to manage because their global nature requires coordinated reasoning and enforcement. To address this problem, we describe a programming model that makes the system responsible for ensuring adherence to privacy policies. The programming model has two components: 1) core programs describing functionality independent of privacy concerns and 2) declarative, decentralized policies controlling how sensitive values are disclosed. Each sensitive value encapsulates multiple views; policies describe which views are allowed based on the output context. The system is responsible for automatically ensuring that outputs are consistent with the policies. We have implemented this programming model in a new functional constraint language named Jeeves. In Jeeves, sensitive values are introduced as symbolic variables and policies correspond to constraints that are resolved at output channels. We have implemented Jeeves as a Scala library using an SMT solver as a model finder. In this paper we describe the dynamic and static semantics of Jeeves and the properties about policy enforcement that the semantics guarantees. We also describe our experience implementing a conference management system and a social network.},
